# Test Driven Hardening (TDH) - Research Framework

A methodology that brings scientific rigor and Test-Driven Development principles to security hardening through distributed LLM consensus.

## 🧪 What is Test Driven Hardening?

Test Driven Hardening (TDH) is a security remediation framework where every fix must be:
1. **Preceded** by a failing test that demonstrates exploitability
2. **Followed** by the same test verifying the mitigation
3. **Validated** through distributed consensus of multiple LLMs
4. **Documented** in a self-contained, evidence-based pull request

## 📚 Papers

- **[Theoretical Framework](./papers/theoretical-framework.md)** - Core TDH methodology
- **[ML Defender Case Study](./papers/ml-defender-case-study.md)** - Empirical validation

## 🏗️ Core Principles

- **Evidence Over Opinion**: Every vulnerability must have a reproducible PoC
- **Distributed Consensus**: Multiple LLMs provide unbiased technical review  
- **Human-as-President**: Engineers make final decisions with full context
- **Institutional Learning**: Every fix becomes documented knowledge

## 🔗 Relationship to ML Defender Pipeline

This framework was born from and empirically validated in the [ML Defender Pipeline](https://github.com/your-org/ml-defender), which serves as the reference implementation and testing ground.

## 🚧 Status

Early research framework. Papers are in active development based on real-world application.
