# Contributing to Test Driven Hardening

We welcome contributions that advance the science and practice of evidence-based security hardening.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Research Contributions
- **Extend the theoretical framework** with new insights
- **Provide additional case studies** applying TDH principles
- **Conduct empirical validations** in different domains
- **Propose architectural improvements** to the framework

### 2. Documentation Improvements
- Clarify concepts and methodologies
- Add examples and implementation guides
- Improve accessibility and understanding

### 3. Implementation Contributions
- Prototypes of TDH components
- Integration examples with existing tools
- Performance optimizations and benchmarks

## Submission Process

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch** for your contribution
3. **Make your changes** with clear documentation
4. **Submit a Pull Request** with:
   - Description of changes
   - Rationale and evidence
   - References to related work

## Quality Standards

All contributions should align with TDH principles:
- **Evidence-based**: Support claims with data or reproducible examples
- **Scientific rigor**: Follow hypothesis→experiment→conclusion methodology
- **Clear documentation**: Explain the what, why, and how
- **Practical applicability**: Consider real-world implementation

## Code of Conduct
